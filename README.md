Muckle
======

From the Scottish for "many", Muckle is a scriptable HTTP load and functional test framework.

A "work in progress" hence no distributable yet (the source mass had become large enough
that it was worth having off site storage during the remainder of the development).

Utilising the netty.io Netty "asynchronous event-driven network application framework" project 
and Mozilla Rhino Javascript engine, Muckle will hopefully provide something useful to those 
interested in web and web service operation and performance.
